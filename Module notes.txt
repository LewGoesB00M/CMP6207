    ACID Properties:
        Atomic - Transaction takes place (commit) or does not (abort)
        Consistency - The database must remain consistent before and after transactions.
        Isolation - Multiple transactions should be able to occur independently with no interference.
        Durability - The changes made as part of a successful transaction occur even if there are system errors.

    NoSQL means "Not Only SQL".
