MongoDB Community Server does NOT include the Mongo shell, which then needs to be installed seperately.
For convenience, the shell should be added to PATH to ensure it can be run from any CMD window.

MongoDB VSCode extension provides a nice compatibility layer that allows you to immediately run files against the 
DB from within VSCode. I don't know how to do it without the extension, so that'll need researching.
